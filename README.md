- 👋 Hi, I’m @clilly123
- 👀 I’m interested in web design (and lots of other things, but for now that's what's on my mind).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics. I'm about as novice as they come to the world of coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites for massage therapists.
- 📫 How to reach me ... chelsea@caphillmassage.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a massage therapist by trade and I got interested in coding because I need a website and didn't really like any of the available themes.
